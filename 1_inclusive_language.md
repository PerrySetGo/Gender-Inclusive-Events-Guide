## Using inclusive language to determine eligibility

### Premise(s):

* Language shapes reality. By naming things we define them.
* Terms we use can include/exclude, create awareness and trust or break it.

### Path:

Create strong signals for people _ahead of time_. Then back them up with action.

### Result:
When people feel included, they participate.

### Wording choices:

Instead of relating to people using fixed, identity-based qualifiers, we can achieve the same with action (process) qualifiers. Here’s how:

_**Replace**_:

“Do you identify as a woman in tech? Yes/No?”

_**With**_:

* Do you consider yourself part of a underrepresented group in tech?
* Do you support work of women and other underrepresented minorities (URMs) in tech fighting for gender equality?
* Do you consider yourself part of a underrepresented group in tech?
* Why is it important to you to support women and URMs in tech?
* What struggles do you see women and other URMs in tech facing?
