## Planning Events:

* Choose venue with gender neutral bathrooms, or make sure the venue will let you temporarily create them. Don’t just assume they will! Some won’t!
* Ensure correct information to book travel for speakers or issue honorariums. Not everyone has a government ID in the same name they use publicly
* Include topics regarding trans and non-binary people matter of factly — we are part of life
* Vet speakers for biased language and content — check with community members regarding prior engagements
* Have an inclusive Code of Conduct ([1](https://donutjs.club/conduct/), [2](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct)) that you feel prepared to enforce
* Plan for pronouns stickers, buttons or tags for everyone as part of the registration process — not just for use by trans or non-binary folks
* Don’t ask minority speakers to only speak about minority issues — they have other skills too
* Ask community members what they need instead of assuming
* Plan for parents who need a private place to nurse or pump. This room should be fully private (no clear windows), and have a comfortable chair, a working fridge for milk, a table near the chair to place the pump, a power strip very close to power the pump, in a fully secured room with a locking door, a way to wash pump parts (if there isn't a sink and soap, at the minimum provide wipes and paper towels), a sign on the door identifying the purpose of the room and information about how to get access to it, and it should not be super inconvenient to the event space for going back and forth between procuring the key, using the room, and getting back to the event. You may need an easy way to schedule access to the room if multiple people need access. A signup sheet works.

### Key takeaways:
Be prepared, be proactive, be intentional. It won’t go unnoticed.
