## Event Day

* Make bathrooms clearly accessible to all
* Everyone writes their pronouns, everyone should respect pronouns
* Model key phrases people can use to ask pronouns. “How do you spell your name? “And what pronoun should I use with you?”
* Don’t misgender speakers, hosts or presenters — it can be _very_ hard to retain professional composure after being misgendered. Practice if you are announcing and having a hard time getting it right
* Clearly provide a code of conduct and encourage people to read it, and understand the repercussions of violating it
* Consider implementing Social Rules that help [manage microaggressions](https://www.recurse.com/manual). (Scroll down to “Social Rules”)
* Keep in mind that a person’s current physical presentation, gender, pronouns etc may not match their ID.
* Be ready and informed to deal with critical pushback. Again, practice can help — talk to your co-organizers, and make sure they have answers to common questions
* Label t-shirts as “Straight Cut” and “Fitted Cut” instead of “Women’s” and “Men’s”. Some men are curvy. Some women are not.

### Key takeaways:
* Everyone should have a pronoun button and ask others their pronouns, not just the people who “need” to.
* Promptly show support should someone report disrespectful behaviour. Consider the trust being placed in your organisation getting this right.

Again, you don’t want to have to repair a broken relationship with a person or group. Information spreads quickly through slack, twitter, etc. — try and get it right before something negative happens.
